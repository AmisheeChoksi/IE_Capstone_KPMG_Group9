# IE_Capstone_KPMG_Group9

This project was developed for the IE Capstone Project with the dataset provided by KPMG of ACME Textile Corp.

There are 4 notebooks available, and should be reviewed in the following order:
1. Capstone_SARIMA Models 
2. Capstone_Other Models 
3. Capstone_LSTM  
4. Capstone_Pycaret  

The final model chosen is the SARIMA model, and the results from the predictions are stored as a json file (combined_forecasts)
